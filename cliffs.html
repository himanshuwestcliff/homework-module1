      <h2>About the Cliffs</h2>
      <p>
        The greatest cliffs are these four cliffs located in southern
        California. Each of these cliffs have their own uniqueness and beauty:
        West Cliff, North Cliff, East Cliff and South Cliff are the pride of
        California. Each cliff has many amenities to offer visitors such as
        recreational areas, camping sites, wildlife watch spots and overnight
        cabins.
      </p>
      <h2>Famous Cliffs</h2>
      <p>
        No matter which direction you head from Irvine, California, the sites
        are easily reached within a 100 mile radius. West Cliff is the most
        popular among Westcliff University campus students because of its close
        proximity.
